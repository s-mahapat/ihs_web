        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>Theoretical considerations about use of health state valuations:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Theoretical interpretations about the object of measurement have some impact on the methodological path leading up to health status weights. Three different interpretations have been made in the literature, namely: (a) individual preference, (b) descriptive measure of health state and (c) social preference weight attached to the health state. Culyer (1989) distinguished between "welfarist" and "extra-welfarist" approaches to health status measurement among economist. The "Welfarist" approach consists of viewing individual preferences (utility) as the source of all social welfare. Health state or disability weight is viewed to represent individual preference for different health states. Since health outcomes at a personal level are characterised by uncertainty, Von Neuman and Morgenstern’s (VNM) expected utility theory is applied. Thus health state weights are viewed as VNM utility. Viewing health state weight as a measure of personal utility means that an equivalence with utility of other goods and services is straightforward. Advocates of personal utility interpretations may not, however, emphasise this equivalence in deference to strong emotional responses against valuation of human life in money terms. "Extra-welfarists" view health as the principal outcome of health services. The health state weight describes this output i.e. the health -related quality of life (Bleichrodt, 1997). The third interpretation, that quality adjustment weights are values under a social welfare function ,is proposed by Nord (1994). Patrick et al (1973) also recognised that quality adjustment weights derived from the equivalence (person tradeoff) method would represent valuation under some social welfare function.

        <p class="ihs-para">
            Another analytic issue is concerned with how to treat the large amount of illnesses that exist but for which people do not seek treatment. It has been observed that aggregate measures like the sickness rate (number of persons falling ill per time period) or illness episodes per time period based on simple count and the implied equal weightage to illnesses of all severity, are too stable and non-responsive to variations of incidence of more severe illnesses (Logan and Brooke 1957). This is in fact the primary motivation behind the search for a set of unequal health state weights. The relative weight to illness of different severity will depend on the current concept of health. At a time characterised by survival as the dominant concept of health, weights attached to all forms of morbidity are nearly zero. As the concept of health evolves to include absence of disease, more severe forms of disability begin to receive higher weightage, both in the minds of the patients and public. Further evolution of the concept of health to include quality of life would naturally enhance the weightage received by illnesses considered minor and trivial in an earlier era. Rosser (1983) notes that even though Logan and Brooke, in 1957, sought to increase the sensitivity of aggregate indicators of morbidity by splitting down some categories (thereby assigning zero weightage to excluded conditions), such an approach would not be relevant in view of increasing concerns about these so-called minor and trivial illnesses.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Health status measures differ in sensitivity to minor and trivial illnesses. For example, the Quality of Well Being scale (QWB) is known to be more sensitive to small departures from perfect health (McDowell and Newell, 1996 p.483-491). This is because the QWB construct includes a symptom complex dimension. For example, Erickson et al (1989) found that the QWB scale classified 95% of the 45-64 year -old population in less than perfect health compared to 75% when activity limitation was used as the criterion. On the other hand EuroQol is less sensitive to small departures from perfect health (McDowell and Newell, 1996 p480-483). This instrument differentiates between more severe forms of morbidity but lumps all morbidities at the healthy end of the scale
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Thus, the choice of instrument in assigning health state weight will have an impact on the kind of policy application to which the resultant aggregate measure of disease burden can be assigned. For example, generic health status measures insensitive to small variations in functional status in a particular dimensions or sub-dimension, would not be suitable to demonstrate the efficacy of a new therapy acting to improve the quality of life in that dimension or sub -dimension alone. This is the rationale for many condition-specific health status measurement scales. Here the policy application of health status measurement is in approval of new formulations and procedures, etc. A different kind of policy application involves the allocation of resources at the macro economic level. For this purpose, a generic health status measurement allowing for comparison of a large number of health care interventions would be useful. Within the class of generic health status measurement, scales may vary in their sensitiveness to different levels of disability. For example, if a health state valuation instrument is not sensitive to minor and trivial illnesses, the resultant disease burden estimates would not be useful for planning of ambulatory services.

        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>How to describe health states for valuation:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            When asked to value time spent in a health state without information about the key domains of health, a respondent must guess what the level in those dimensions will be. This will inevitably introduce measurement error and a potential for bias in the results. Another consideration is how to convey relevant information about a hypothetical health state to the individual undertaking the valuation, who might not have personally encountered the state. Disease labels are short and parsimonious, but do not convey adequate information about functional status. Moreover, disease labels are vulnerable to different interpretations based on cultural and personal settings. Issues relevant to development of a health state description systems have been described by Boyle and Torrance (1984), and Froberg and Kane I-IV (1989). Briefly, four important considerations guide us in defining the description space (number of dimensions) and the inclusion of specific attributes of human health.

        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>How to convey health state descriptions effectively to an individual undertaking the valuations:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Effective communication of the description to individuals acting as valuers has many difficulties. The descriptive system must be comprehensible to the young, middle-aged and older adults with widely varying levels of educational attainment, socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. For example, differences have been found between using paragraphs written in the first person in describing a health state, and using straight lists of levels in each domain of health (Llewellyn-Thomas et al. 1982). The descriptive system should be meaningful across cultures. Translation of instruments should produce equivalence in terms of word meanings and idioms i.e. semantic and idiomatic equivalence; equivalence in terms of situations and concepts evoked in the descriptions i.e. experiential and conceptual equivalence, respectively (Guillemin et al, 1993). The description system should enable communication with semi-literate as well as illiterate persons. The description systems used so far have been developed for literate societies like North America and Europe. Even here, studies have experienced communication difficulties due to language barriers. For example, in the Canadian study by Sackett and Torrance (1978), about 12% of the randomly selected sample had to be excluded, because the interviewees could not communicate in English. One way to deal with this problem is to supplement written descriptions with appropriate graphical representations. Some researchers have used multimedia methods for valuation exercises (Lennert and Hornberger 1996, Lennert and Soetikno 1997). One problem with multimedia solutions is that the computer may be a source of distraction, particularly where the general community has limited experience with multimedia. In any case, multimedia solutions need a graphical description system to start with. So description systems for partially literate and multi- lingual communities should ideally include a graphical description sub system.

        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>General study design:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            A study was conducted in Andhra Pradesh, at the Institute of Health Systems (IHS), to measure peoples’ preferences about various health states. The broad goals of this study were:

                    <p class="ihs-para">To strengthen the methodological foundation for population-based measurement of health state weights. Because population-based empirical assessments of health states are extremely limited, new surveys are needed.

            </ol>
        </div>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Two distinct sources of assessment were made. One arm of the study consisted of a series of multi-method deliberative health state valuation (MDHSV) workshops for educated persons from different backgrounds. Participants of these workshops valued health states using more than one procedure card sort, including, visual analogue scale, time tradeoff, and person tradeoff methods. The second arm of the study involved measurement of valuations given by general population drawn from a rural area, done by conducting household surveys in Kondakkal village in Ranga Reddy district of Andhra Pradesh. Respondents in the community survey were requested to give their valuations using card sort followed by visual analogue scales.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>Selection of index health states for the study:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Although synthetic health status measures would require health state weights for a large number of conditions, a health state valuation study has its limitations in generating direct valuations for a large number of conditions. Health state valuation exercises are usually characterised by high cognitive load on the valuers. Hence a valuer is usually given a limited set of conditions. Increasing the number of conditions would lead to valuer fatigue, resulting in poor validity and reliability of the measurements. A practical alternative is to use a small set of conditions to measure peoples’ preference and then statistically infer the health state values for other states. The small set of conditions used to gather measurements on peoples, valuation of health states, is referred to as index health states or synonymously indicator conditions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>Guidelines for choice of indicator conditions:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Before proceeding with the selection of indicator conditions, we take stock of principles and guidelines relevant for choice of index health states. Parts of the health state valuation exercise require the valuer to deliberate about all health states at hand and assign values to each. Hence, the number of health states presented to a single valuer should be kept within manageable limits to minimise incidence of cognitive overload. This limit is a function of human working memory and cognitive behaviour, and is independent of sample size. The limit is all the more significant for population-based surveys, where multiple sessions would not usually be feasible. Gudex et al (1996) limited the number of health states per valuer to 15, for a population-based survey in UK. Sacket and Torrance included 10 health states for their population based survey in Hamilton, Otario Canada (Sackett and Torrance, 1978). The EuroQol group (Brooks, 1996) found, it was feasible for a person to value about 12-16 health states using the EuroQol instrument.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Secondly, study design and data analysis considerations should be kept in view. For example, the set of index health states should represent widest range of health state profiles. This will allow statistical inference of health state weights for conditions for which no direct measurement is available. Hence it is important that the set of indicator conditions maximise the independent variation in each dimension of health status. The need to maximise independent variation along each dimension and the constraint imposed by the ability of valuers in dealing with a number of conditions, run counter to each other. Since the limit on number of health states for valuation by an individual is fixed on psychometric grounds, the only scope to increase variation in dimensions of health status is to increase sample size and present different sets of conditions to different persons. Comparability and linkage between different health states would require that some health states be common for all valuation sets: these are known as core health states. The inclusion of a few pairs of dominating and dominated health states will facilitate inference about the validity of measurement protocol. A state that is unequivocally worse than another state in at least one dimension and at most equivalent in all others, is considered a dominated condition. One that is unequivocally better than another state in at least one dimension, and at the least, equivalent in all, is considered a dominating condition. Examples of dominating and dominated pairs of health states are: amputation of one leg below the knee, and amputation of the both the legs below the knee, quadriplegia and paraplegia. Then the proportion of times that ranks for dominated states are inverted can be used as a measure of (or lack of) the health state comprehension.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Finally, local relevance and familiarity of health states and its effect on valuer motivation has to be considered. Health states corresponding to diseases not found or found very rarely in the local population should be avoided. Since a descriptive label for each health state is retained to facilitate synthetic comprehension by the valuer, going for conditions that are hitherto unheard-of would not be helpful. Such conditions might demotivate valuers due to lack of apparent purpose of the exercise. Instead, at least some health states corresponding to diseases highly prevalent and / or considered important public health problems in the local area should be included. This is required to increase valuer's motivation and allow for a sense of purpose in the valuation exercise. On the other hand, health states associated with disease labels known to be a taboo, to provoke a sense of outrage or subject to widely prevalent stereotypes, should be avoided. The disease label is likely to dominate the valuer’s thought process to near total exclusion of the health state profile. There would appear to be some conflict between the need to avoid stereotypes and the goal of seeking locally prevalent health states, described earlier. Indeed, there would be some diseases which are highly prevalent and carry a strong stereotype. So, quite naturally, the art of selecting indicator conditions requires careful weighing of potential confounding due to various factors, and the feasibility of getting valuer’s co-operation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>Health states chosen for this study:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            The number of health states to be valued by a single valuer was limited to 11, to minimise incidence of cognitive overload, and valuer fatigue. The study, however, sought to directly measure disability weights for a larger set of conditions. According to original plan, 22 health states were chosen for the study, apart from the valuer’s own health state. Six of these health states were used as the core, common to all valuers. The remaining 16 health states were divided into four subsets. Each subset added to the core subset, made a set of health states. Accordingly, the study planned for four sets of health states. The six core conditions were selected to represent a broad range of 6D5L profile and disability severity weights. While making up these lists, conditions known to be prevalent in Andhra Pradesh were included, and conditions not found in AP were excluded, while trying to keep the list as comparable with the ones used at other study sites for international comparability. Thus, the selection of indicator conditions involved several rounds of discussion between local investigators at IHS and study co-ordinators at WHO. Sets were systematically assigned to balance assignment of valuers to different sets of health states.

        <div class="page-header">
            <h4 style="text-align: center">Future research needs for health state valuation</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            More extensive research is required if community-based measurements of health state valuations are to be used in summary measures of population health status. Apropos, the nature of the valuation function and its characteristics for different health states, we have seen, from test and retest data, that ordinal rankings are not consistent with conventional notion that the individual has a single valued function. Conventional economic theory of well-ordered preferences assumes that an individual has a clear pair wise ordering of alternatives. Our observations in this study suggests that the valuation in a person's mind for a given health state may be a multivalued function. The range of values over which the valuation function is defined is a function of the health state and the extent of cumulative deliberations by the individual. This hypothesis needs to be tested through more studies. There are two research questions here: whether the health state valuation functions are multivalued or single valued and if the health state valuation function is indeed multivalued, which factors determine the range of values (i.e. the image space) it can assume. The incidence/prevalence of the health state, associated taboo, severity level, health state description system, and deliberations by the individual are some factors worth exploring . The extent to which a person has deliberated about a health state may affects the size of the health state valuation image space. Our conjecture is that, upto some point, increased opportunity for deliberations about the value of a health state would narrow down the health state valuation image space. This has important implications for the methodology to be adopted for community measurement of health state valuations. If increased opportunity for deliberations do indeed lead to narrowing of the health state valuation image space, then repeated measurements accompanied by an opportunity for deliberation and reflections on the concerned health state would improve the reliability of measurements. If there are no such relationships, then a larger sample size may be the only means to improve reliability of health state valuation measurements from a community.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            So far health state valuation studies have used a set of indicator conditions to obtain valuations from a community and have used various interpolation strategies to assign disability weights to other health states. Such interpolated values are estimates of mean health state values that might have been measured from the community. This study has clearly brought out the reference that health states vary in the extent to which community has crystallised valuations for it. The extent to which community valuations for a health state is diffused or crystallised has important implications for its use in summary measures of population health status. The mean disability weight may be adequate enough for health states with crystallised community valuations. In case community valuation for a health state is diffused, the mean does not have much significance as an input for summary measures of population health state. For such health states, either an uncertainty analysis by multiple simulations or a sensitivity analysis giving endpoint values from the range of valuations would be desirable. In other words, the distribution of valuations in the community is of as much importance as the estimated mean of health state valuations. It is difficult to predict the distribution of all health states from the distribution of indicator conditions. Hence, future research will have to directly measure valuation by communities for all health states. Operationalising such measurements in single studies may be difficult. But appropriate strategies can be found out once we are clear of the need for direct measurements from communities for as many health states as is possible.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Thirdly, more research is required to study the efficacy of health state description systems in reliably communicating the same state to all individuals. This line of research will be more culture-specific. Two areas need attention: the semantic content of statements used to describe the severity levels along each dimension and the validity and reliability of the graphical description system. In this study we have developed a graphical description system. The graphics were chosen from out of about five to six alternatives, by showing the pictures to a convenience sample of persons. It will be useful to study more formally the validity and reliability of the graphical description system in communicating a given health state. Such research projects should include plans for further refinement of the graphics. These studies are important for measurement of health state values in partially literate, as well as multicultural communities. Once we know enough about semantically equivalent statements of severity levels and have equivalent graphics, it should be possible to develop multimedia description systems.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Finally, more studies are required about the nature of relationship between different measurement methods. For example, the VAS and TTO valuations in the study was found to be similar. This is different from earlier findings that TTO generally gives lower disability weights for milder conditions, compared to VAS. Future studies should carefully document details of measurement techniques, measurement context, interviewer and valuer characteristics, so that factors contributing to differences in valuations between the two methods and between sites can be identified.

            <h4 style="text-align: center">Summary findings</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            An important contribution of this study is the advancement of methodological aspects of health state valuation in developing country communities. A health state description system incorporating a graphical description component was developed to facilitate communication in partially literate communities. Some deliberative tools for conduct of health state valuation workshops for educated persons were developed. The experience gained for valuation of health states in developing country settings, we hope, will help in future research.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Apropos the substantive aspect of the subject, this study has shed some light and raised many questions about the nature of the health state valuation process in our minds. Analysis of test and retest data on ordinal ranking of health states, valuation of own health state and differences in distribution of valuations at the community level, all lead us to hypothesise that the true health state valuation in our minds is a multivalued fuzzy set with different degrees of clarification. Conventional theory that the true valuation is a single valued function is not consistent with our observations, and appears intuitively less appealing.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Health state valuation studies will have to contend with the problem of measurement error, as is the case in most other areas of psychometric measurement. Unfortunately, we do not yet have a fully worked out measurement model for health state valuations. Most studies use reliability measures conceived under the classical test theory developed in the context of educational testing and measurement. In the field of educational measurement, it is generally assumed that the object of measurement is distributed normally with some variance. If the variance component attributable to subjects is high, then educational tests are considered reliable. We have seen that community valuation of health states follow different distributions. Health state valuations are not personal endowments that can be assumed to be distributed normally in a fashion similar to, say, intelligence. If community valuation for a health state is well crystallised, then the true variance of subjective valuations will be less as compared to health states where the valuation is more diffused. The generalisability theory allows for a more realistic modelling of the measurement process. Reliability of the health state valuations in this study can be said to be moderate, on the basis of obtained generalisability coefficient (0.56 to 0.67) and conventional reliability measures like ICC (0.6), within valuer correlation (around 0.6 to 0.8) and within valuer ICC (0.6 to 0.8). However, a more appropriate measurement model of health state valuation will help in correct estimation of reliability.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            The incidence of measurement error and our present understanding about the nature of valuation process would suggest that community level valuation of health states requires a large sample size as also repeated measurements. Large sample sizes would help minimise the measurement error for mean values estimated form community surveys. Repeated measures, it is anticipated, will occasion repeated deliberation by the valuers and thereby help clarification of their value sets. The tradeoffs between sample size and repeated measurements will have to be studied.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            The health state valuation instruments used in this study have good content validity, considering that they have been derived by many people working from similar conceptual definitions of health and are based on empirical listing of health state attributes by some large studies. The criterion validity of health state valuation instruments cannot be tested, since we do not have a good standard for this purpose. The instruments have shown good convergent validity. Measurements from multiple methods like, the visual analogue scale, time tradeoff, and person tradeoff agreed quite well with each other. Incorporation of ordinal rank consistency requirement in valuation tasks appeared to facilitate deliberation. 
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Ordinal rank consistent visual analogue scaling (VAS) turned out to be a fairly valid tool for the measurement of health state values. The VAS valuations agreed quite well with valuations from other methods like time trade-off and person trade-off. In fact VAS did better in some cases. For example, the incidence of counterintuitive valuations was lower for VAS. Considering its simplicity, and the feasibility for community surveys, VAS appears to be the instrument of choice for measurement of health state valuations.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            So far, researchers have focused on the mean valuations. This study has demonstrated that community valuation of all health states do not follow the same distribution. The degree of crystallisation of valuations appears to be health state dependent. Valuations for some states are quite diffused, for example, infertility. Valuations for some others are well crystallised, for example, quadriplegia. Differences in distribution of valuations by the community for different health states has policy implications, and hence, should be the subject of further research. This implies that health state valuation studies using a few indicator conditions will not provide required inputs for summary measures of population health. Data on indicator conditions, allow for statistical decomposition of multiattribute valuations and model based estimation of disability weights for other health states. These statistical models can estimation mean valuations only, but can not provide any information about distribution. The only way to understand distribution of valuations for all health states is to measure valuations for each of them in the concerned community.
