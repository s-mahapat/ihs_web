        <p class="ihs-para">
            Adverse health effects attributable to air pollution are an important public health problem. Air pollutants such as particulate matter have damaging effects on human health. Estimates of the health damages associated with air pollution are required to assess the size of the problem and to evaluate the impact of specific pollution control measures. The IES programme was designed to integrate solutions for multiple benefits. The health effects analysis study aimed to identify and analyze the air quality, public health and GHG mitigation “co-benefits “ in transportation and industrial sectors, to develop an initial estimation of the health impacts of PM10 (Particulate matter of 10 microns diameter) in Hyderabad and their social costs. The analysis was conducted for Business as Usual (BAU) and four identified alternative mitigation scenarios. The magnitude of health impacts in relation to PM10 exposure was calculated using both a health risk assessment approach and percentage increases of mortality or morbidity per unit increase of air pollutant concentration. The analysis was based on Concentration Response (CR) functions derived from available epidemiological studies. Health benefits were computed using Human Capital Approach (HCA) for mortality valuation, and the Cost of Illness (COI) approach for valuing morbidity. Transportation sector is the largest contributor to air emissions (approx. 70% of the total load) in Hyderabad . The effective bus transit mitigation scenario resulted in, 1/3rd reduction of PM10 concentrations compared to BAU levels, and the most significant decreases in mortality and occurrence of CVD and other respiratory diseases. The transportation sector was recognized as an area, where significant air quality and public health benefits could be realized through the IES, India Analysis. The project started in November, 2002 and was funded by the USAID<sup>[1]</sup>.
