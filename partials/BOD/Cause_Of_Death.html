            Premature mortality is a major contributor to disease burden. According to the GBD estimates (Murray and Lopez, 1996) the YLL component of DALYs was about 50% in established market economies, where the epidemiological transition had already taken place. In former socialist economies, China, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), 57%-58% of disease burden was due to premature mortality. In India, Middle Eastern Crescent (MEC), the rest of Asia and islands (OAI), YLLs contributed 65-69% of total DALYs lost in 1990. In sub - Saharan Africa, more than 75% of DALYs was contributed by YLLs. In case of India 84% of the disease burden among children was estimated to be on account of premature mortality. A little more than half of DALYs, lost among older children and young adults, was due to premature mortality. For older people, the contribution of premature mortality to disease burden was 66% or higher. Hence the causes of these deaths is important for health policy.

            Since the major share of disease burden would be from premature mortality, accurate estimate of causes of death would constrain the accuracy of burden of disease estimates. Here we describe, for rural and urban areas of AP, respectively, the existing statistical base for cause of death reporting. We present results from a study undertaken in Andhra Pradesh to improve the accuracy of cause of death data from the rural areas. Our study on causes of death in urban areas of AP is currently underway. Mean while, we have used medically certified cause of death statistics from the neighbouring state of Maharashtra, where coverage of the medical certification of cause of death is better.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>A brief overview of the cause of death reporting systems in India:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            At the national level, the Registrar General of India (RGI) is responsible for collection, collation and publication of cause of death statistics. At the state level, the Vital Statistics Division of the Directorate of Health deals with cause of death statistics. Cause of death reports originate from lay reporters in rural areas and medical attendants in urban areas. The reports reach the State Vital Statistics office through the primary health centre, in case of rural areas, and the municipal health office for urban areas. Tabulation is usually done at the state level but the statistics are published by the RGI. Until December 1998, cause of death data for the rural areas used to be collected under the Survey of Cause of Death Rural (SCD-Rural) scheme, from a sample of villages by a lay diagnosis and reporting system. A paramedical person from the PHC is designated as the field agent who undertakes the primary survey. (S)he identifies key informants and maintains liaison with them. A household register is drawn up and updated on a half yearly basis. For each death occurring in the village, the field agent identifies one or more persons having knowledge of the circumstances of death, interviews them and records the symptoms and circumstances of death in Form-7. A structured questionnaire is used to investigate cause of death using the symptoms and circumstances of death. The structured questionnaire is supplemented by a check list. The field agent arrives at a probable cause of death by applying the structured questionnaire to symptoms and circumstances recorded in Form-7. The check list entry against the probable cause of death is tallied with the symptoms and circumstances of death. The cause of death thus arrived is reported in Form-3. The PHC statistician is designated as the recorder of events reported by the field agent. Half-yearly verification of the household list is done by the recorder. Medical officer of the PHC is expected to check and certify the correctness of cause of death assignment by the field agent. Assignment of cause of death is done by the field agent based on a structured interview with a member of concerned household. The structured questionnaire currently in use was adopted after taking into account five years of field experience with a provisional questionnaire. The non medical list (NML) of causes of death was last revised in 1983 to correspond to ICD ninth revision (RGI, 1991). SCD-Rural used verbal autopsy (VA) to arrive at cause of deaths using paramedical personnel.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            From January 1999 a cause of death component has been added to the SRS (RGI, 1999). We call this the SRS-COD component. Two more columns have been added to SRS Form-5 (Columns 16-17) and Form-10 (columns 12-13). The SRS part-time enumerator (PTE) records cause of death in column 16 and the code in column 17 of the revised Form-5. The SRS supervisor records similar information in columns 12 and 13 of the revised Form-10. A major departure from the SCD-Rural design is doing away with the symptom record (SCD-Rural Form-7). Another departure from the SCD-Rural is the elimination of the structured questionnaire. Instead the instructions contain a list of causes, related symptoms for some, and the corresponding ICD-10 code.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            In case of the urban areas, a medical certification of cause of death (MCCD) scheme is operational. This scheme has been acceded legal sanction under the Registration of Births and Deaths (RBD) Act. All medically attended deaths are expected to be registered (Form-2) along with cause of death reports in a format (Form-4) which is similar to what is prescribed by the WHO for International Classification of Cause of Death (ICD). The responsibility for reporting cause of death rests with the doctor / health care provider who last attended on the deceased. Reports are sent to the municipal health authorities, who forward them to the concerned state vital statistics office. The medical attendant is required to follow guidelines contained in the Physician's manual on medical certification of cause of death (RGI, 1992). This manual prescribed the WHO form for reporting cause of death according to the current version of ICD. Coding and tabulation is done according to the National List which is an adaptation of the ICD basic tabulation list. Since the MCCD essentially implements ICD coding and guidelines, the design of the system is considered satisfactory.

        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>Characteristics of an usable cause of death reporting system:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            Ruzicka and Lopez (1990) have listed five criteria used by the World Health Organisation to assess fitness of country-level cause of death data for inclusion in its compilations. Firstly, the proportion of all deaths attributed to residual categories such as "Symptoms, signs and ill defined conditions" is within limits, say less than 10%. Secondly, the proportionate distribution of deaths by cause is consistent with the estimated mortality level for that country. Thirdly, no cause of death with a clear age-sex dependency has been incorrectly assigned. Fourthly, the age-sex distribution for major causes is consistent with what one may expect for each cause. Finally, data generated by the system are consistent with previous years. Note that these are basically plausibility checks. A data set failing these criteria is more likely to be biased. A data set satisfying these criteria may still not be usable, on account of poor statistical power of the generated estimates, and biases that are not readily noticeable. Building upon the criteria suggested by Ruzicka and Lopez (1990), we have identified the following nine criteria to assess the usability of any cause of death statistics:

            We examine, below, the usability of the cause of death statistics in India from the rural and urban areas respectively. We take up each usability criteria, discuss its implications briefly and then examine how India's cause of death statistics fares, using national statistics and state level statistics from Andhra Pradesh. Where required, we supplement the published statistics with information about Andhra Pradesh, available to us from our study on cause of death in Andhra Pradesh.

        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>Content validity of the verbal autopsy algorithm for lay reporting of cause of death in India:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            Design characteristics of the reporting system have a bearing on the usability of cause of death statistics. For example, changes in the guidelines of the international classification of causes of death (ICD) have been seen to cause reduction or increase in assignment of deaths to certain causes, depending on the specific changes brought by the particular version of the ICD. Analogously, guidelines for verbal autopsy can have some effect on the cause of death structure produced by the concerned cause of death reporting system.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>General design features of a verbal autopsy system:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            The verbal autopsy method has been studied and applied in many parts of the world. For example the demographic surveillance system (DSS) in Matlab, Bangladesh (Nahar et al 1985; Zimicki, 1990); assessment of child mortality in Latin America (Puffer and Serrano, 1973); monitoring endemic diseases in West Africa (Bradley and Gilles, 1984; Greenwood et al, 1987) in Kenya (Omondi-Odhiambo et al, 1984), Namibia (Mobley and Ties, 1996); in Phillipines (Kalter et al, 1990) and in India (Bang et al 1992; Awasthi and Pande, 1998). Much of the VA related work, however, remains unpublished. For example the WHO-UNICEF (1994) memorandum on measurement of cause-specific mortality in children cites many unpublished sources.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            The current knowledge base on feasibility and validity of VA is largely restricted to childhood mortality. The WHO-UNICEF memorandum, cited above, summarizes results of validation studies and has tabulated sensitivity and specificity of VA for detecting major causes of childhood death. In addition, the memorandum contains expert opinion about use of VA for investigation of causes of childhood death. This memorandum was the result of an internal consultation in December 1992 in which experts engaged in research and implementation of VA participated. Bang et al (1992) have used consensus development techniques to synthesize expert opinion on diagnostic criteria for identification of causes of childhood deaths. They have developed questionnaires incorporating local terminologies in their study area (Gadchiroli, Maharashtra) to generate the required information by verbal autopsy to satisfy the coding algorithm.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            Studies about the validity of VA in identifying causes of adult death have been undertaken recently (Garenne and Fontaine, 1989; LSHTM, 1993). Garene and Fontaine (1989) have reported their experience in Senegal. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) workshop (1993) on verbal autopsy tools for adult deaths was conducted on the eve of a study in sub Saharan Africa. Proceedings of this workshop, cited above, documents a consensus of expert opinion about VA for adult deaths. The World Bank working paper by Hayes et al. (1989), is another summary and source of expert opinion. Chandramohan et al (1994) have published discussions at the LSHTM verbal autopsy workshop and have summarized all VA-based studies published upto mid-1993. Certain general design features are the key to wide applicability, efficiency and validity of data generated by a VA based cause of death reporting system. Over the years, some degree of consensus on major design issues has been achieved. I have drawn upon these sources in order, to critically examine the extent to which SCD-Rural meets the criteria of a good VA-based system.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            The structured questionnaires of the SCD-Rural system are systematically examined for each of the conditions included in the non-medical list, in the light of available research results on verbal autopsy. SCD-Rural seems to satisfy most of these criteria except that of reporting multiple causes of death. However, assigning multiple causes of death creates problems for aggregation and reporting of deaths by cause. Manton and Stallard (1984) analyzed multiple cause of death patterns in the USA. Although their preferred suggestion is to use patterns of failure as the basis of analysis, it may not be a feasible alternative considering the small sample sizes inherent in verbal autopsy-based statistics. To the extent that certain deaths are assigned to a combination of causes, there will be reduction in number of deaths reported under the respective component causes (LSHTM, 1993). A compromise may be to restrict the number of multiple causes of death to a manageable number and develop algorithms to distribute these to their component causes. Manton and Stallard’s (1984) study suggests that recording upto three multiple causes would include more than two third of deaths. Choosing the top three most probable causes contributing to death may help improve the accuracy of estimates and keep it manageable.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            The trade off between the open-ended interview and the structured questionnaire needs further elaboration. Although an open-ended interview format allows for the pursuit of unusual diagnostic clues not covered by a structured questionnaire, it requires more skilled interviewers. For example, comparatively lower assignments to unknown category have been achieved with physicians acting as interviewers (Greenwood et al 1987). Open-ended interviews and coding of cause based on the judgment of the interviewer reduces the inter-regional and inter-temporal comparability of cause of death statistics.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            Since SCD-Rural satisfies most of the general design criteria for VA, does it follow that the statistics generated by it would automatically be valid? Not necessarily. Validity of classification of deaths to particular causes will depend on characteristics of the cause of death per se, as also the content of the questionnaire and algorithm used for specific disease entities the latter two of which are discussed in the next sub section.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>Validity of SCD-Rural disease-specific algorithms:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            As the WHO-UNICEF (1994) consultation noted, VA is suitable only for causes that have clear and unambiguous set of symptoms at the time of death. The symptoms and signs chosen to code deaths due to a particular disease should result in most of the deaths truly due to the concerned cause to be coded as such (sensitivity) and exclude other causes that may have related symptoms. In addition, the choice of symptoms and signs must be parsimonious to reduce interviewer and interviewee fatigue. At the very least, questions and coding algorithms should have face and content validity. In other words, they should be based on expert judgment about their usefulness in identifying and excluding specific causes. In addition, validity with respect to a criterion will be desirable. The validity of an instrument is assessed by comparing its result with some reference standard. Thus the choice of a reference standard is the key to empirical validation of VA algorithms.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            The gold standard reference for assignment of cause of death has been the autopsy. This is not a practicable solution to validate VA, since the later alternative to medical certification of cause of death is considered only in areas with scarce medical facilities. Two other references have been proposed (LSHTM, 1993) and used, namely (a) hospital diagnosis and (b) clinical diagnosis. To validate VA with respect to hospital diagnoses, deaths in a community are coded using the VA instrument under testing. If the deceased happened to have been hospitalized, the medical records from hospital are retrieved. The reference cause of death is assigned on the basis of the person's medical record in hospital. Alternatively patients discharged from a hospital may be followed up after a lapse of time and deaths if any may be coded by VA. The hospital-based reference diagnosis and the VA-based code are then compared. Selection bias is a major shortcoming of hospitals based reference. The LSHTM workshop discussed possible ways of reducing selection bias. An example of hospital diagnosis-based reference is the study in Kenya by Snow et al (1992). In this study hospital diagnosis was used as a reference to check validity of cause of death coded by physicians from verbal autopsy data. On the other hand, clinical diagnosis in the community has less of a selection bias. This would require a lot of medical manpower, which may not be available in an area for which VA is considered. It may, however, be possible to temporarily mobilize physicians for purposes of a validation study, since methodological lessons learnt from it would be useful for wider application. Kalter et al (1990) used physician diagnosis as the reference to estimate validity of different verbal autopsy based algorithms. Zimicki (1990) compared interviews by lay reporters with in-depth interview by physicians.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            Sometimes empirical validity of VA tools are assessed indirectly by checking consistency of VA-based statistics with known epidemiological patterns. One approach has used known efficacy of vaccination to reduce mortality due to concerned disease. Validity of a VA tool measuring mortality due to that disease may be indirectly inferred from the time trend of estimates generated by it and vaccination coverage. Stephens (1990) studied measles-related morbidity and mortality data collected by nonmedical field interviewers in a rural area in Senegal. Data on measles incidence and cause-specific mortality was aggregated by hamlets. Stephens examined if the movement of measles epidemic from hamlet to hamlet implied by the verbal autopsy data was consistent with known epidemiologic pattern of measles and vaccination coverage in respective hamlets.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            SCD-Rural algorithm organizes all causes, at the highest level, into ten modules based on obvious age-sex-major symptom complex. The solution to the first round of questions about applicability of these modules leads the interviewer into the detailed questions under that module. It will be fairly obvious to determine if the death was due to, say, accidents and injuries (SCD module-1), maternity (module-2) or if it was of an infant less than one year old. There is a problem about the last module on senility. There are no further expansions of causes under senility. Criteria for inclusion under senility is that the person was extremely old and apparently not sick? The person should be above 60 years and none of the specific causes in SCD list be traced. The age criteria of more than 60 years would tend to put more deaths under this category.

For 12 causes under Accident and Injuries, expert opinion is not available for an individual or specific cause. However, there is a general agreement that these causes are obvious to lay reporters and hence verbal autopsy is considered to accurately assign deaths due to these causes. For similar reasons, the six causes under maternal deaths is not shown. Senility and other residual codes are not shown.

            The SCD structured questions and checklist were compared with currently available expert opinion or validity information for respective causes of death in the SCD non medical list. Altogether there are 57 specific causes in the SCD non- medical list, excluding the residual categories. Accidents and injuries account for 12 of these. Consensus about validity of VA to code deaths due to accidents and injuries is quite strong, since most of these are easily recognized by lay persons. Discussions of VA on accidents and injuries are not available in the literature. So is the case with deaths due to maternal causes, under which SCD non medical list contains 7 causes. Excluding these 19 causes under accidents, injuries and maternal deaths, there are 38 specific codes in the rest of the SCD non- medical list. At least some expert opinion or validity information is available for 24 out of these 38 causes.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            As can be seen in the above table , most of the causes for which some expert opinion is available are infant deaths, respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases. For 21 out of these 24 causes the SCD questions appear to be in accordance with expert opinion and validity information available in the literature. The three causes for which there is major discrepancy are (a) cord infection, (b) pre maturity, and (c) cancer. Most experts agree and validation studies show that verbal autopsy is good at detecting neonatal tetanus. In SCD-Rural, neonatal tetanus is included under cord infection and thereby misses an opportunity for accurate estimation of deaths due to a cause which is very important from public health point of view. Experts opine that it is usually difficult to distinguish between prematurity and low birth weight (Garene and Fontaine, 1989; Gray, 1989). Hence they ought to be lumped together for accuracy of VA-based statistics. The SCD-Rural list does not include low birth weight in its list. It can be added to prematurity without any disturbance to the structure of the rest of the questionnaire. The SCD-Rural list homogenizes all cancers into one cause. Some expert opinion is usually available by site of cancer. Moreover some cancers would have symptoms which may be confused with the filter questions for other modules. For example, stomach cancer cases may be investigated as deaths due to digestive diseases. In that case, the field agent may not get to consider stomach cancer at all since there is no mention of it in the digestive causes module. So is the case for lung cancer.

        <p class="ihs-para">	
            Nonavailability of expert opinion or information pertaining to validity in the SCD-Rural nonmedical list does not imply that they are primaital facie not valid. The SCD-Rural design was based on expert opinion obtained at the time of drawing up blue print of the scheme and revision of manuals. The SCD-Rural design process included a phase of field testing of provisional questionnaires and finalisation by expert consultation. Considering the large extent to which questions for specific causes are in accord with expert opinion and information from VA validity studies, the SCD-Rural questionnaire appears to be prima facie valid.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            The prima facie validity of SCD-Rural questionnaire is reassuring in the sense that the scheme design is largely in accord with current knowledge about verbal autopsy. But it does not assure us that the cause of death statistics are accurate for all causes. In case of causes for which VA is known to be highly sensitive and specific (say more than 75% for each) the SCD statistics can be mapped to medical causes directly. For other causes, more detailed algorithms for mapping of SCD statistics onto the desired set of medical causes will have to take into account available knowledge about the sensitivity and specificity of VA in general and specific peculiarities of SCD as also implementation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>SRS-COD Component:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            From January 1999, the survey of cause of death was integrated with the SRS (RGI, 1999). It is understood that the SCD-Rural guidelines have been extended to the SRS-COD component. Although formal communication regarding this is yet to be made available, we were able to obtain a copy of the RGI rules and regulations on "Collection of data on causes of death" (Director of Census Operations, Andhra Pradesh, 1999). The elimination of the symptom record (SCD-Rural Form-7) has been a major departure from the SCD-Rural design. The SCD-Rural symptom record was similar in content to the WHO's cause of death report format, which requires information about the underlying causes of death. The SRS-COD component asks field agents to record the code to which the cause of death is assigned. No further information about symptoms and circumstances of death need be reported. This later information is required for the systematic screening and coding of cause of death reports. The phasing out of the structured questionnaire constitutes another significant departure from the SCD - Rural. Instead the instructions contain a list of causes, related symptoms for some diseases, and the corresponding ICD10 code. For some causes, no description of expected symptoms has been furnished. However, it is too early to sit in judgment on the new system. It will nevertheless be helpful if specific research studies are taken up to evaluate the performance of the new cause of death reporting system in rural areas.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            The SRS-COD component is designed to generate verbal autopsy-based information on the causes of death for urban and rural areas, since SRS operates both in rural and urban areas. This will result in two sources of cause of death data from urban areas, namely the (a) SRS-COD component, and (b) the Medical Certification of Cause of Death (MCCD) reports. It is claimed that this will allow for comprehensive statistics on cause of death for all areas of India. While the availability of verbal autopsy-based cause of death data for urban areas will allow for some plausibility checks and comparisons with the MCCD based data, the latter source is certainly more preferable, as it is based on medical certification. Urban areas face the hazard of poor co-operation offered by hospitals and medical attendants. This is mainly due to the fact that there is no effort, whatsoever by municipal authorities in demanding compliance with provisions of the Registration of BD Act. about reporting of cause of death.

            Based on our knowledge of pathophysiology and disease epidemiology, a certain age pattern of deaths due to a cause can be expected. For example, we know that deaths due to cancer generally increase with age. We use this fact to assess the quality of cause of death statistics. If the age pattern of deaths attributed to a cause is found to deviate sharply from the expected age pattern, we suspect the validity of the cause of death statistics. The best way to perceive major deviations in age pattern is to look at graphs indicating the age pattern of deaths attributed to a cause. We plotted such graphs for the top ten causes, using data for five consecutive years (1991 to 1995). Apropos SCD-Rural, these causes included suicide, excessive heat, gastroenteritis, tuberculosis, bronchitis, pneumonia, paralysis, congestive heart disease, heart attack and jaundice. In case of MCCD, these causes included: ischaemic heart disease, tuberculosis, lower respiratory tract infection, low birth weight, cerebrovascular disease, diarrhoeal disease, road accidents, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, fires and birth asphyxia / birth trauma. Twenty such graphs were plotted (10 for SCD-Rural and 10 for MCCD) where each graph had 10 plots at the rate of two plots (female and male) for each year. The plots were visually examined, for unusual age patterns if any. No instance of unusual age pattern was detected. Assignment of deaths to neoplasm are known to be affected by deficiency in cause of death reporting systems. Hence the age pattern of such deaths as reported by SCD-Rural in 1995 and MCCD in 1995, 1996 (the graphs are not shown here) was examined. It is expected that mortality due to cancers increases as age advances. The plot of data from SCD-Rural 1995 also reflected the expected trend. But the plots of data from MCCD showed a decline in cause specific death rate after 55 years which we inferred was most probably due to the under-diagnosis of cancers at older ages. On the whole, it was found that by and large age-sex pattern of deaths attributed to major causes, by the Indian cause of death reporting systems followed expected patterns. However, the existence of deviations in age pattern for a few causes cannot be ruled out. The overall performance of this aspect of the system is deemed satisfactory.

        <p class="text-left"><strong>Can we improve the cause of death reporting system in India?</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            We have examined the cause of death reporting system in India, using the nine aforementioned criteria to assess the usability of the cause of death statistics generated thereof . In Table -3.12 we summarize the findings and give our own rating of the contemporary Indian cause of death reporting system. We have followed a three category rating consisting of satisfactory, tolerable and poor. The prime factors affecting usability of the cause of death statistics in India are (a) poor coverage, (b) tendency to assign deaths to residual and "unclassifiable" categories, (c) long delay and irregular publication of statistics, and (d) lack of systematic screening. We present herewith our subjective assessment of factors contributing to various aspects of poor performance, and then discuss possible measures that we think will improve the usability of cause of death statistics in India.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            Poor coverage has two aspects, namely (a) a total lack of reporting from certain areas, and (b) under- reporting from other areas. These areas are sample villages in case of SCD-Rural and non-reporting municipalities in case of the MCCD. Total non-compliance is a result of lack of awareness. A visit to a few SCD-Rural training programmes in Andhra Pradesh during the year 1998 revealed that some PHC medical officers were totally unaware of the cause of death reporting system that was supposed to operate in their area. Total apathy reigns supreme at all levels, regardless of whether the areas concerned are urban or rural. Most health care institutions, clinical teams, medical attendants and municipal offices are manifestly guilty of either ignorance or complacency, thus contributing to very poor coverage by cause of death reporting systems. Much of this apathy and managerial inattention could be attributed perhaps to the fact that the data is being analysed at the national level. There is neither any mechanism or any effort to analyse cause of death data at the state level and use the results for state level health policy analysis. Consequently, field agents and medical practitioners neither have any means of direct feedback about the nature of utilisation of data collected by them nor do they perceive any stake in the latter. This contributes to a gradual deterioration in the accuracy of cause of death statistics.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            A review of the state of cause of death reporting systems and revamping of the is needed. It is imperative for each state to build an infrastructure for local analysis of causes of death. Sponsored research to analyse cause of death statistics and the implications for health policy, will, it is hoped, generate the requisite enthusiasm for usable statistics. In addition, state departments of health and municipal administration need to pay some managerial attention and periodically review the performance of cause of death reporting systems. We feel that if the initiative is taken up by the health and municipal administration departments, consecutively for a period of, say, five years, the coverage of the MCCD scheme would improve substantially. It is our conjecture that once coverage is increased substantially to about 80% of estimated deaths, it is likely to sustain itself without the need for much managerial and supervisory resources. A drive is in order, so that there is widespread awareness of the links between filing of individual cause of death reports and the utility of cause of death statistics in planning and policy analysis. The RBD Act provides for a fine of upto Rs. 50 for the absence of, or incorrect of filling of cause of death reports. Our experience in Andhra Pradesh proves that this provision has not been used at all. The fine prescribed by the RBD Act is more of a token amount than a real financial burden on health care providers. We feel that this fact can be suitably exploited to increase awareness among health care providers about filing cause of death report so that the fine is an effective reminder to defaulting health care providers, enabling them to comply with the legal requirement of filing a cause of death report.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            The high incidence of unclassifiable deaths can be attributed to report-writing skills. Chiefs of clinical units do not appropriately emphasize the importance of writing up the cause of death report. Short term training programmes that help build cause of death report writing skills are necessary to remedy this lacuna. Non maintenance or poor maintenance of medical records also contribute to inaccurate assignment of cause of death. Faced with a situation of inadequate information from medical records, the physician writing the cause of death report tends to the assign the death to unclassifiable category or to some miscellaneous codes. Hence the RBD Act needs further amendments requiring health care providers to maintain appropriate medical records in order to facilitate accurate classification of cause of death.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            Delay in compilation and publication of cause of death statistics can be further reduced by computerising the operations. At present a lot of the tabulation work is done manually. Some amount of computerisation has already been implemented in the office of the RGI, which in turn has also been subcontracting data entry to private computer service providers. Computerisation needs to be enforced at the state level, so that state level statistics can be published locally and utilised to inform state health policies. The tabulation and publication of state level statistics should be decentralised to State Vital Statistics offices. If the operations are computerised at the state and municipal level, this decentralisation can be achieved without any significant addition to current staff. Suffice to say that computerisation of cause of death report filling and collation is essential.
        </p>

        <p class="ihs-para">	
            Valid and reliable statistics on cause of death is an essential input for the setting of priorities in the health sector. Major initiatives to systematically identify health sector priorities have used cause of death information. An ideal cause of death reporting system consists of: (a) a fully developed vital registration system with, (b) cent percent medical attendance at the time of death, and (c) full compliance by the health care providers in the writing and filing of cause of death reports. Developing countries like India are making efforts to operate cause of death reporting systems that are feasible within the given constraints of partially developed registration of vital events and poor availability of medical facilities. We examine the cause of death reporting systems in India and usability of the statistics. For rural areas, cause of death statistics used to be collected through the SCD-Rural scheme which operated till December 1998.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            There after, rural cause of death statistics is sought be generated by adding a few columns to capture cause of death information for deaths reported under the SRS-COD component. For urban areas, there is the medical certification of cause of death (MCCD) scheme extended by state governments, mostly to municipalities and urban areas. To assess the utility of cause of death statistics, we examine the SCD-Rural and MCCD data for a period of about five years in the first half of the 1990s using nine criteria for utility. These usability criteria are: (a) content validity of lay reporting systems, (b) adequate coverage and compliance, (c) validity of statistics at sub-national levels of disaggregation, (d) minimal usage of residual categories, such as unclassifiable or ill defined conditions, (e) consistency of cause- specific mortality proportions with general mortality level, (f) absence of incorrect assignment of causes with clear age-sex dependency, (g) no case of improbable age-sex distribution by cause, (h) consistency of cause-specific mortality proportion over time, and (i) timely compilation and publication of the statistics.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            We find that major factors affecting the usability of the cause of death statistics in India are (a) poor coverage, (b) high incidence of unclassifiable deaths, (c) long delay and irregular publication of statistics, and (d) lack of systematic screening. We recommend, based on our subjective understanding of the problems, certain measures required to improve the utility of cause of death statistics in India. We propose that a drive be launched by the Ministry of Health, Government of India, and all State Governments through the Ministries of Health and Municipal Administration, to improve coverage by cause of death reporting systems. Based on our experience in Andhra Pradesh, we conjecture that introducing periodical reviews jointly by the Departments of Health and Municipal Administration, identification of non-reporting municipalities and sample units, and further identification of non reporting health care institutions sustained over a period of, say ,five years, will improve coverage substantially. Other measures recommended by us include: (a) training programmes to hone cause of death report writing skills among physicians, (b) compilation and publication of cause of death statistics at the State level, (c) sponsored research on cause of death structure and their policy implications, (d) computerisation of filing, tabulation and flow of cause of death statistics, both at the municipality and state level. To reduce the unusually high level of unclassifiable deaths, we recommend that an amendment be brought in the Registration of Births and Deaths Act (RBD Act.) making the maintenance of records mandatory in hospitals and health care institutions . We are unable to make any definite recommendations specifically for the rural areas, since system has been revamped recently. We wish to point out that the cause of death columns added to the SRS data collection forms do not provide for recording of symptoms necessary for the systematic screening and coding of cause of death reports. However, it is too early to sit in judgment on the new system. Research is recommended in order to evaluate the performance of the new cause of death reporting system in rural areas.

            To estimate the cause of death structure in rural areas, we implemented the Andhra Pradesh Rural Cause of Death (APRCD) study, 1998. All SCD-Rural death reports received by the state's Vital Statistics Division for a nine-month period, 1998 April to December, were systematically reviewed by a physician. SCD-Rural system uses verbal autopsy to determine cause of death in sample areas. Reports considered to have adequate information for assignment of cause of death from the non- medical list were coded by the physician. In some cases, this code was identical to code originally given by the SCD-Rural system and for some others there was a change in coding. Reports without adequate information for assignment of cause of death were dispatched for field enquiry and on-site review by a physician. A final cause of death code was assigned based on the on-site review. Additional deaths were detected by the visiting physicians from the same sample villages and pertaining to the study period. These deaths were investigated using verbal autopsy and a cause of death was assigned after systematic screening by another physician reviewer. Altogether 3842 deaths from the rural areas of Andhra Pradesh were investigated. For urban areas, MCCD data from the neighbouring state of Maharashtra for the years 1986-90 was used as an approximation. Deaths by cause in the rural and urban areas respectively were added up to arrive at the estimate of causes of death in Andhra Pradesh.

            The above figure indicates the cause-specific mortality proportions for the same ten causes but within different age groups. Lower respiratory infection (LRI), diarrhoeal diseases and low birth weight predominantly affect infants and children. Poor nutrition, unsafe water, poor sanitation, and personal hygiene as well as access to appropriate treatment are responsible for the three main causes of death among children. In young adults, suicides and tuberculosis are the top causes of death. High incidence of suicides is a pointer to educational, social and cultural factors. Tuberculosis continues to be an important public health problem despite decade-long programmes to control the incidence of this disease. Ischaemic heart disease shows up as an important cause of death among older adults and further increases as age advances. Other important causes of death for older adults are cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, asthma and Stomach cancer. Ischaemic heart diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases call for changes in lifestyle. Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases point to the need for control of indoor and outdoor air pollution and smoking. Stomach cancer could be, to some extent, dealt with by early diagnosis and treatment. In a nutshell, the mortality profile of Andhra Pradesh clearly reflects the persisting problems arising from poor nutrition, water supply and hygiene as also socio- cultural problems and the emergence of non communicable and degenerative diseases.
