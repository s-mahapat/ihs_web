            Premature mortality is a major contributor to disease burden. According to the GBD estimates (Murray and Lopez, 1996) the YLL component of DALYs was about 50% in established market economies, where the epidemiological transition had already taken place. In former socialist economies, China, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), 57%-58% of disease burden was due to premature mortality. In India, Middle Eastern Crescent (MEC), the rest of Asia and islands (OAI), YLLs contributed 65-69% of total DALYs lost in 1990. In sub - Saharan Africa, more than 75% of DALYs was contributed by YLLs. In case of India 84% of the disease burden among children was estimated to be on account of premature mortality. A little more than half of DALYs, lost among older children and young adults, was due to premature mortality. For older people, the contribution of premature mortality to disease burden was 66% or higher. Hence the causes of these deaths is important for health policy.

            Since the major share of disease burden would be from premature mortality, accurate estimate of causes of death would constrain the accuracy of burden of disease estimates. Here we describe, for rural and urban areas of AP, respectively, the existing statistical base for cause of death reporting. We present results from a study undertaken in Andhra Pradesh to improve the accuracy of cause of death data from the rural areas. Our study on causes of death in urban areas of AP is currently underway. Mean while, we have used medically certified cause of death statistics from the neighbouring state of Maharashtra, where coverage of the medical certification of cause of death is better.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>A brief overview of the cause of death reporting systems in India:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            At the national level, the Registrar General of India (RGI) is responsible for collection, collation and publication of cause of death statistics. At the state level, the Vital Statistics Division of the Directorate of Health deals with cause of death statistics. Cause of death reports originate from lay reporters in rural areas and medical attendants in urban areas. The reports reach the State Vital Statistics office through the primary health centre, in case of rural areas, and the municipal health office for urban areas. Tabulation is usually done at the state level but the statistics are published by the RGI. Until December 1998, cause of death data for the rural areas used to be collected under the Survey of Cause of Death Rural (SCD-Rural) scheme, from a sample of villages by a lay diagnosis and reporting system. A paramedical person from the PHC is designated as the field agent who undertakes the primary survey. (S)he identifies key informants and maintains liaison with them. A household register is drawn up and updated on a half yearly basis. For each death occurring in the village, the field agent identifies one or more persons having knowledge of the circumstances of death, interviews them and records the symptoms and circumstances of death in Form-7. A structured questionnaire is used to investigate cause of death using the symptoms and circumstances of death. The structured questionnaire is supplemented by a check list. The field agent arrives at a probable cause of death by applying the structured questionnaire to symptoms and circumstances recorded in Form-7. The check list entry against the probable cause of death is tallied with the symptoms and circumstances of death. The cause of death thus arrived is reported in Form-3. The PHC statistician is designated as the recorder of events reported by the field agent. Half-yearly verification of the household list is done by the recorder. Medical officer of the PHC is expected to check and certify the correctness of cause of death assignment by the field agent. Assignment of cause of death is done by the field agent based on a structured interview with a member of concerned household. The structured questionnaire currently in use was adopted after taking into account five years of field experience with a provisional questionnaire. The non medical list (NML) of causes of death was last revised in 1983 to correspond to ICD ninth revision (RGI, 1991). SCD-Rural used verbal autopsy (VA) to arrive at cause of deaths using paramedical personnel.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            From January 1999 a cause of death component has been added to the SRS (RGI, 1999). We call this the SRS-COD component. Two more columns have been added to SRS Form-5 (Columns 16-17) and Form-10 (columns 12-13). The SRS part-time enumerator (PTE) records cause of death in column 16 and the code in column 17 of the revised Form-5. The SRS supervisor records similar information in columns 12 and 13 of the revised Form-10. A major departure from the SCD-Rural design is doing away with the symptom record (SCD-Rural Form-7). Another departure from the SCD-Rural is the elimination of the structured questionnaire. Instead the instructions contain a list of causes, related symptoms for some, and the corresponding ICD-10 code.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            In case of the urban areas, a medical certification of cause of death (MCCD) scheme is operational. This scheme has been acceded legal sanction under the Registration of Births and Deaths (RBD) Act. All medically attended deaths are expected to be registered (Form-2) along with cause of death reports in a format (Form-4) which is similar to what is prescribed by the WHO for International Classification of Cause of Death (ICD). The responsibility for reporting cause of death rests with the doctor / health care provider who last attended on the deceased. Reports are sent to the municipal health authorities, who forward them to the concerned state vital statistics office. The medical attendant is required to follow guidelines contained in the Physician's manual on medical certification of cause of death (RGI, 1992). This manual prescribed the WHO form for reporting cause of death according to the current version of ICD. Coding and tabulation is done according to the National List which is an adaptation of the ICD basic tabulation list. Since the MCCD essentially implements ICD coding and guidelines, the design of the system is considered satisfactory.

        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>Characteristics of an usable cause of death reporting system:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            Ruzicka and Lopez (1990) have listed five criteria used by the World Health Organisation to assess fitness of country-level cause of death data for inclusion in its compilations. Firstly, the proportion of all deaths attributed to residual categories such as "Symptoms, signs and ill defined conditions" is within limits, say less than 10%. Secondly, the proportionate distribution of deaths by cause is consistent with the estimated mortality level for that country. Thirdly, no cause of death with a clear age-sex dependency has been incorrectly assigned. Fourthly, the age-sex distribution for major causes is consistent with what one may expect for each cause. Finally, data generated by the system are consistent with previous years. Note that these are basically plausibility checks. A data set failing these criteria is more likely to be biased. A data set satisfying these criteria may still not be usable, on account of poor statistical power of the generated estimates, and biases that are not readily noticeable. Building upon the criteria suggested by Ruzicka and Lopez (1990), we have identified the following nine criteria to assess the usability of any cause of death statistics:

We take up each usability criteria, discuss its implications briefly and then examine how India's cause of death statistics fares, using national statistics and state level statistics from Andhra Pradesh. Where required, we supplement the published statistics with information about Andhra Pradesh, available to us from our study on cause of death in Andhra Pradesh.

        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>Content validity of the verbal autopsy algorithm for lay reporting of cause of death in India:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            Design characteristics of the reporting system have a bearing on the usability of cause of death statistics. For example, changes in the guidelines of the international classification of causes of death (ICD) have been seen to cause reduction or increase in assignment of deaths to certain causes, depending on the specific changes brought by the particular version of the ICD. Analogously, guidelines for verbal autopsy can have some effect on the cause of death structure produced by the concerned cause of death reporting system.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>General design features of a verbal autopsy system:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            The verbal autopsy method has been studied and applied in many parts of the world. For example the demographic surveillance system (DSS) in Matlab, Bangladesh (Nahar et al 1985; Zimicki, 1990); assessment of child mortality in Latin America (Puffer and Serrano, 1973); monitoring endemic diseases in West Africa (Bradley and Gilles, 1984; Greenwood et al, 1987) in Kenya (Omondi-Odhiambo et al, 1984), Namibia (Mobley and Ties, 1996); in Phillipines (Kalter et al, 1990) and in India (Bang et al 1992; Awasthi and Pande, 1998). Much of the VA related work, however, remains unpublished. For example the WHO-UNICEF (1994) memorandum on measurement of cause-specific mortality in children cites many unpublished sources.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            The current knowledge base on feasibility and validity of VA is largely restricted to childhood mortality. The WHO-UNICEF memorandum, cited above, summarizes results of validation studies and has tabulated sensitivity and specificity of VA for detecting major causes of childhood death. In addition, the memorandum contains expert opinion about use of VA for investigation of causes of childhood death. This memorandum was the result of an internal consultation in December 1992 in which experts engaged in research and implementation of VA participated. Bang et al (1992) have used consensus development techniques to synthesize expert opinion on diagnostic criteria for identification of causes of childhood deaths. They have developed questionnaires incorporating local terminologies in their study area (Gadchiroli, Maharashtra) to generate the required information by verbal autopsy to satisfy the coding algorithm.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            Studies about the validity of VA in identifying causes of adult death have been undertaken recently (Garenne and Fontaine, 1989; LSHTM, 1993). Garene and Fontaine (1989) have reported their experience in Senegal. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) workshop (1993) on verbal autopsy tools for adult deaths was conducted on the eve of a study in sub Saharan Africa. Proceedings of this workshop, cited above, documents a consensus of expert opinion about VA for adult deaths. The World Bank working paper by Hayes et al. (1989), is another summary and source of expert opinion. Chandramohan et al (1994) have published discussions at the LSHTM verbal autopsy workshop and have summarized all VA-based studies published upto mid-1993. Certain general design features are the key to wide applicability, efficiency and validity of data generated by a VA based cause of death reporting system. Over the years, some degree of consensus on major design issues has been achieved. I have drawn upon these sources in order, to critically examine the extent to which SCD-Rural meets the criteria of a good VA-based system.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            The structured questionnaires of the SCD-Rural system are systematically examined for each of the conditions included in the non-medical list, in the light of available research results on verbal autopsy. SCD-Rural seems to satisfy most of these criteria except that of reporting multiple causes of death. However, assigning multiple causes of death creates problems for aggregation and reporting of deaths by cause. Manton and Stallard (1984) analyzed multiple cause of death patterns in the USA. Although their preferred suggestion is to use patterns of failure as the basis of analysis, it may not be a feasible alternative considering the small sample sizes inherent in verbal autopsy-based statistics. To the extent that certain deaths are assigned to a combination of causes, there will be reduction in number of deaths reported under the respective component causes (LSHTM, 1993). A compromise may be to restrict the number of multiple causes of death to a manageable number and develop algorithms to distribute these to their component causes. Manton and Stallard’s (1984) study suggests that recording upto three multiple causes would include more than two third of deaths. Choosing the top three most probable causes contributing to death may help improve the accuracy of estimates and keep it manageable.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            The trade off between the open-ended interview and the structured questionnaire needs further elaboration. Although an open-ended interview format allows for the pursuit of unusual diagnostic clues not covered by a structured questionnaire, it requires more skilled interviewers. For example, comparatively lower assignments to unknown category have been achieved with physicians acting as interviewers (Greenwood et al 1987). Open-ended interviews and coding of cause based on the judgment of the interviewer reduces the inter-regional and inter-temporal comparability of cause of death statistics.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            Since SCD-Rural satisfies most of the general design criteria for VA, does it follow that the statistics generated by it would automatically be valid? Not necessarily. Validity of classification of deaths to particular causes will depend on characteristics of the cause of death per se, as also the content of the questionnaire and algorithm used for specific disease entities the latter two of which are discussed in the next sub section.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left text-primary"><strong>Validity of SCD-Rural disease-specific algorithms:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            As the WHO-UNICEF (1994) consultation noted, VA is suitable only for causes that have clear and unambiguous set of symptoms at the time of death. The symptoms and signs chosen to code deaths due to a particular disease should result in most of the deaths truly due to the concerned cause to be coded as such (sensitivity) and exclude other causes that may have related symptoms. In addition, the choice of symptoms and signs must be parsimonious to reduce interviewer and interviewee fatigue. At the very least, questions and coding algorithms should have face and content validity. In other words, they should be based on expert judgment about their usefulness in identifying and excluding specific causes. In addition, validity with respect to a criterion will be desirable. The validity of an instrument is assessed by comparing its result with some reference standard. Thus the choice of a reference standard is the key to empirical validation of VA algorithms.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            The gold standard reference for assignment of cause of death has been the autopsy. This is not a practicable solution to validate VA, since the later alternative to medical certification of cause of death is considered only in areas with scarce medical facilities. Two other references have been proposed (LSHTM, 1993) and used, namely (a) hospital diagnosis and (b) clinical diagnosis. To validate VA with respect to hospital diagnoses, deaths in a community are coded using the VA instrument under testing. If the deceased happened to have been hospitalized, the medical records from hospital are retrieved. The reference cause of death is assigned on the basis of the person's medical record in hospital. Alternatively patients discharged from a hospital may be followed up after a lapse of time and deaths if any may be coded by VA. The hospital-based reference diagnosis and the VA-based code are then compared. Selection bias is a major shortcoming of hospitals based reference. The LSHTM workshop discussed possible ways of reducing selection bias. An example of hospital diagnosis-based reference is the study in Kenya by Snow et al (1992). In this study hospital diagnosis was used as a reference to check validity of cause of death coded by physicians from verbal autopsy data. On the other hand, clinical diagnosis in the community has less of a selection bias. This would require a lot of medical manpower, which may not be available in an area for which VA is considered. It may, however, be possible to temporarily mobilize physicians for purposes of a validation study, since methodological lessons learnt from it would be useful for wider application. Kalter et al (1990) used physician diagnosis as the reference to estimate validity of different verbal autopsy based algorithms. Zimicki (1990) compared interviews by lay reporters with in-depth interview by physicians.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            Sometimes empirical validity of VA tools are assessed indirectly by checking consistency of VA-based statistics with known epidemiological patterns. One approach has used known efficacy of vaccination to reduce mortality due to concerned disease. Validity of a VA tool measuring mortality due to that disease may be indirectly inferred from the time trend of estimates generated by it and vaccination coverage. Stephens (1990) studied measles-related morbidity and mortality data collected by nonmedical field interviewers in a rural area in Senegal. Data on measles incidence and cause-specific mortality was aggregated by hamlets. Stephens examined if the movement of measles epidemic from hamlet to hamlet implied by the verbal autopsy data was consistent with known epidemiologic pattern of measles and vaccination coverage in respective hamlets.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            SCD-Rural algorithm organizes all causes, at the highest level, into ten modules based on obvious age-sex-major symptom complex. The solution to the first round of questions about applicability of these modules leads the interviewer into the detailed questions under that module. It will be fairly obvious to determine if the death was due to, say, accidents and injuries (SCD module-1), maternity (module-2) or if it was of an infant less than one year old. There is a problem about the last module on senility. There are no further expansions of causes under senility. Criteria for inclusion under senility is that the person was extremely old and apparently not sick? The person should be above 60 years and none of the specific causes in SCD list be traced. The age criteria of more than 60 years would tend to put more deaths under this category.

                        Figures in parentheses are the number of conditions within the group. For 12 causes under Accident and Injuries, expert opinion is not available for an individual or specific cause. However, there is a general agreement that these causes are obvious to lay reporters and hence verbal autopsy is considered to accurately assign deaths due to these causes. For similar reasons, the six causes under maternal deaths is not shown. Senility and other residual codes are not shown.

            The SCD structured questions and checklist were compared with currently available expert opinion or validity information for respective causes of death in the SCD non medical list. Altogether there are 57 specific causes in the SCD non- medical list, excluding the residual categories. Accidents and injuries account for 12 of these. Consensus about validity of VA to code deaths due to accidents and injuries is quite strong, since most of these are easily recognized by lay persons. Discussions of VA on accidents and injuries are not available in the literature. So is the case with deaths due to maternal causes, under which SCD non medical list contains 7 causes. Excluding these 19 causes under accidents, injuries and maternal deaths, there are 38 specific codes in the rest of the SCD non- medical list. At least some expert opinion or validity information is available for 24 out of these 38 causes.

        <p class="ihs-para">	
            As can be seen in the above table , most of the causes for which some expert opinion is available are infant deaths, respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases. For 21 out of these 24 causes the SCD questions appear to be in accordance with expert opinion and validity information available in the literature. The three causes for which there is major discrepancy are (a) cord infection, (b) pre maturity, and (c) cancer. Most experts agree and validation studies show that verbal autopsy is good at detecting neonatal tetanus. In SCD-Rural, neonatal tetanus is included under cord infection and thereby misses an opportunity for accurate estimation of deaths due to a cause which is very important from public health point of view. Experts opine that it is usually difficult to distinguish between prematurity and low birth weight (Garene and Fontaine, 1989; Gray, 1989). Hence they ought to be lumped together for accuracy of VA-based statistics. The SCD-Rural list does not include low birth weight in its list. It can be added to prematurity without any disturbance to the structure of the rest of the questionnaire. The SCD-Rural list homogenizes all cancers into one cause. Some expert opinion is usually available by site of cancer. Moreover some cancers would have symptoms which may be confused with the filter questions for other modules. For example, stomach cancer cases may be investigated as deaths due to digestive diseases. In that case, the field agent may not get to consider stomach cancer at all since there is no mention of it in the digestive causes module. So is the case for lung cancer.

            Nonavailability of expert opinion or information pertaining to validity in the SCD-Rural nonmedical list does not imply that they are primaital facie not valid. The SCD-Rural design was based on expert opinion obtained at the time of drawing up blue print of the scheme and revision of manuals. The SCD-Rural design process included a phase of field testing of provisional questionnaires and finalisation by expert consultation. Considering the large extent to which questions for specific causes are in accord with expert opinion and information from VA validity studies, the SCD-Rural questionnaire appears to be prima facie valid.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">	
            The prima facie validity of SCD-Rural questionnaire is reassuring in the sense that the scheme design is largely in accord with current knowledge about verbal autopsy. But it does not assure us that the cause of death statistics are accurate for all causes. In case of causes for which VA is known to be highly sensitive and specific (say more than 75% for each) the SCD statistics can be mapped to medical causes directly. For other causes, more detailed algorithms for mapping of SCD statistics onto the desired set of medical causes will have to take into account available knowledge about the sensitivity and specificity of VA in general and specific peculiarities of SCD as also implementation.
