            The AP Burden of Disease (APBD) estimates arrived at in this study are of importance from two different policy perspectives. National Burden of Disease (NBD) estimate will be of immediate interest to those concerned about health policy of the concerned national or sub-national entity for which the study is made. This study has highlighted the need for reliable and valid local data for National Burden of Disease Estimates. Using the case of Andhra Pradesh in India, the study examines available sources of data and describes their usability. Deficiency in availability of local data is highlighted to draw attention to the need for improving vital statistics, cause of death and epidemiological surveillance systems. The Global Burden of Disease Estimation projects has encouraged internal consistency checks, indirect estimations, synthesis of epidemiological and demographic information, sheer perseverance to tap a wide array of data sources and estimation of missing data points by triangulation. An important contribution of this study is the advancement of methodological aspects of health state valuation in developing country communities. On the substantive aspect of the subject, this study has shed some light and raised many questions about the nature of the health state valuation process in our minds. The study provided an opportunity for a comprehensive estimation of disease burden in AP during the 1990s. Clearly (a) lower respiratory tract infections (LRI), (b) diarrhoeal diseases, (c) low birth weight (LBW), (d) tuberculosis and (e) falls were the top causes of disease burden in AP, during the 1990s. One hopes that the disease burden estimates for Andhra Pradesh prepared now, will help focus policy maker's attention on some of the leading causes of disease burden in the state.

        <h5>Andhra Pradesh Burden of Disease Study Results and important  Causes of Disease Burden</h5>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            We present two estimates of disease burden in Andhra Pradesh. The two differ in the set of disability weights used for the health states. There are different schools of thought and preferences about the method of valuation to directly measure the subjective utility of different health states from individuals. Some believe that VAS tends to obtain a more severe valuation for milder health states, and think that TTO valuations are less biased. Although theoretical justifications for TTO valuations have been advanced, the belief appears to have been strengthened by its closeness to judgements by public health experts about disability weights for various health states.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Health state valuations are by definition individual preferences between different health states. So valuation by public health experts are indeed individual preferences of these professionals. A public health professional can hardly claim any expertise in valuation of health states, except for his / her own valuations. These professionals usually have better knowledge of different health states. In other words their expertise is in visualising description of health states and connecting a disease label to some description. In addition, people may attach some importance to personal preference of public health experts. Extending upon this willingness of people to defer to professional judgement, the expert rated disability weights can also be viewed as objective assignment of health state values. The disability weights used by the GBD96 study were derived from workshops mostly attended by medical and public health experts from different areas and are labelled expert rated disability weights. These disability weights can be considered as aggregated individual preferences from a convenience sample or as objective assignment of weights by public health experts, depending on oneâ€™s point of view. The expressions "expert rated" and "expert judgement" etc. are used here to mean valuation by public health experts.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            The Andhra Pradesh Health State Valuation Study 1999, revealed that the community in Kondakkal village assigned consistently higher disability weights compared to the GBD96 weights. We have seen that part of the difference between APHSV99 community rated disability weights and GBD96 weights can be attributed to VAS. But another part of the difference appears to be real. If VAS is indeed generally scaling the disability weights upwards and more so for milder conditions, then it is in effect giving more weightage to disability component of the summary measure of population health status. In any case the disease burden estimate using VAS-based local measurement of disability weights can be viewed as a scenario giving relatively higher importance to disability component over premature mortality component. Policy makers can then reflect on the commonalties and differences between disease burden estimates based on local cause of death data and a conservative estimate of disability component using generally lower disability weights arrived at by experts, and VAS based measurements of disability weights from community studies. Here the set of disability weights obtained from community survey are referred as community rated disability weights.
        </p>
        <p class="ihs-para">
            Thus the two burden of disease estimates presented below use the (a) expert rated disability weights and (b) community rated disability weights, respectively. The community rated disability weights are generally higher than the expert rated disability weights, for corresponding health states. Hence the burden of disease estimate based on community rated disability weight is expected to emphasise disability component of the disease burden. Such estimates can be useful for planning of health care delivery capacity and types of health care delivery institutions. The expert rated disease burden estimates would show the mortality component of the disease burden more than the other estimate. Hence they can be used to plan for preventive programs and to set priorities for research. Some leading causes of burden may show up in all estimates. Such causes of disease burden found to be important from more than one perspective will naturally deserve greater attention and be prime objects of health policy.

        <h5>APBD estimates using expert rated disability weights:</h5>	
        <p class="ihs-para">Results presented in this section are based on general demographic estimates of mortality level and population, and causes of death in the state. Epidemiological estimates of incidence, age at onset and duration are taken from the Global Burden of Disease study 1996 (Murray and Lopez, 1996) for the India region. The GBD96 disability weights used by Murray and Lopez (1996) for the GBD study are maintained.</p>

            The figure about distribution of DALYs & YLL shows age-sex distribution of disease burden and the composition in terms of YLL : YLD ratios. A lot of disease burden is concentrated in infancy and early childhood. These are mostly due to premature mortality, as can be inferred from the high YLL to YLD ratio in this age group. Within the 0-4 year age group, girl infants and children are more vulnerable to death (YLL:YLD ratio = 4.14), whereas male infants and children live with disability (YLL to YLD ration = 0.83). In adult age group of 15 to 44, the situation is reversed. Among those who suffer, females tend to live with disability and males are more vulnerable to death.Ten leading causes of burden in rural and urban areas of the state is given in the immediate table. Six leading causes are common to both the areas. These are: (a) lower respiratory infections, (b) diarrhoea, (c) low birth weight, (d) ischaemic heart disease, (e) falls and (f) tuberculosis. Poor nutrition, lack of safe drinking water and sanitation are common risk factors for three of these, namely lower respiratory infection, diarrhoea, and low birth weight. Four of these (a, b, c, and f) are already included in various public health and disease control programs of the state. The results obtained here reinforces the desirability of those programs.

            It will be useful to look at the age pattern of the next two top causes of disease burden, namely ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and falls. Age distribution of DALYs lost due to these two conditions is shown in the figure below. The burden on account of ischaemic heart disease occurs at older age groups. The age distribution of DALYs lost on account of falls is just the opposite. Most of the falls appear to occur at younger age groups. Children age group of 5 to 14 years are most vulnerable. Unfortunately, there is no initiative yet to study the causes of fall in children and how they can be prevented. Regarding ischaemic heart disease, a fairly large capacity of curative treatment of cardiac diseases have been developed in the state, mostly in the private sectors, and to some extent in the public sector. Attention on issue of lifestyle, and training of doctors in medical management of myocardial infarction are areas where some state intervention may be called for.

            Among the leading causes of burden unique to the rural area, self-inflicted injury deserves attention. Clearly almost all of these deaths are in the adult age group 15 to 44 years. The DALYs lost due to self-inflicted injury are simply deaths due to suicide and most of it is in rural areas. The age distribution of burden due to fires is similar to age distribution for self-inflicted injuries. DALYs lost on account of fire accidents are mostly among adults and young children. The difference between the age-sex pattern of burden due to fires in urban areas and suicide in rural areas is in the gender distribution. Incidence of self inflicted injuries in rural areas appears to be nearly equal for females and males. In urban areas, females are the major victims of fire accidents. Although fires showed up in the ten leading causes of burden in urban areas, the problem is just as prevalent in rural areas. This is simply due to the large population in the rural areas. Fires have caused both premature mortality and disability.

        <p>Road accidents are another cause for concern, rampant in both urban and rural areas. Although road accidents did not show up within the ten leading causes for rural areas, it happens to be the eleventh cause of burden in rural areas. Victims here are mostly in adults in age group 15-44, although all other age groups do suffer some burden due to road accidents. More males are affected.</p>

            In urban areas, birth asphyxia and trauma are among the ten leading causes of DALYs. Most of this burden is on account of premature mortality. Appearance of the burden due to birth asphyxia and trauma in the urban areas, instead of the whole state, could be due to location of hospitals and nursing homes. Birth asphyxia and trauma are most probably reported from hospitals and nursing homes, most of which are located in urban areas. These would include cases from both rural and urban areas, since hospitals in urban areas do serve surrounding rural hinterlands. Hence, it would be reasonable to say that birth asphyxia and birth trauma is an important cause of disease burden for the whole state. This finding has important implications for policy regarding development of infrastructure for institutional deliveries and also for the quality of maternity services provided by hospitals and nursing homes. The above table shows the leading causes of burden due to premature mortality. Most of the leading causes of overall disease burden, for example, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, low birth weight, tuberculosis, etc are repeated here. In addition, malaria appears as a leading cause of mortality in rural areas.

        <p class="ihs-para">The above table shows leading causes of disability in the state. Falls and fires are among the leading causes of disability. This reflects the fact that falls and fires not only cause loss of life, but also produce a lot of disability. Protein energy malnutrition is a major cause of disability. The burden is on account of developmental disability suffered by children due to poor nutrition. Unipolar major depression is yet another leading cause of disability to be viewed this along with the fact that suicide is a leading cause of premature mortality. Cataract blindness, for which a control program is under implementation, is also among the leading causes of disability.</p>

        <p class="text-center text-primary"><strong>APBD Estimates using community rated disability weights:</strong></p>
        <p class="ihs-para">Results presented in this section are based on the general demographic estimates of mortality level and population, and causes of death in the state. Epidemiological estimates of incidence, age at onset, and duration are taken from the Global Burden of Disease study 1996 (Murray and Lopez, 1996) for the India region. The disability weights are based on VAS results from the community survey of health state valuations in Kondakkal village in Andhra Pradesh (APHSV99-VAS weights).</p>
        <p class="ihs-para">The rural-urban distribution of disease burden in the state figure shows the overall rate of disease burden is higher at 537 DALY / 1000 population compared to 277 DALY / 1000 population according to the estimate using expert rated disability weights. The rate of estimated burden is 560 DALYs / 1000 population in rural areas and 474 DALYs / 1000 population in urban areas. This is expected, since the community ratings of disability weights has been higher than the expert rated disability weights. The share of disease burden in rural areas is slightly less at 76% with a corresponding increase in share of disease burden in urban areas at 24%. The change in rural urban distribution of disease burden is because the rural burden is largely due to premature mortality and the urban disease burden is largely due to degenerative and non communicable diseases. Since the community rated disability weights are higher than the expert rated weights, the years lived with disability due to degenerative and non communicable disease in the urban areas get emphasised. Hence share of urban disease burden increases by 3% with a corresponding decrease in share of disease burden in rural areas.</p>

Except for the elderly age group of 60+ years, the disability component of disease burden is more than the premature mortality component. Most of the YLL:YLD ratios at these age groups are less than one. The sex differentials in disability - premature mortality composition is maintained as in case of the earlier estimate using expert rated disability weights.</p>

        <p>Above table shows ten leading causes of burden in rural and urban areas of the state, according to the estimate using community rated disability weights. According to this estimate, nine leading causes are common to both the areas. These are: (a) periodontal disease, (b) protein energy malnutrition, (c) lower respiratory tract infections, (d) fires, (e) falls, (f) diarrhoeal diseases, (g) low birth weight, (h) obstructed labour, (i) tuberculosis. Five of these (shown in bold) were there in six of the top ten causes common to both rural and urban areas according to the estimate using expert rated disability weights. These are: (a) Low birth weight, (b) Lower respiratory infections, (c) Diarhoeal disease, (d) Fall, and (e) Tuberculosis. Certain diseases characterised mostly by morbidity appear in the present list. For example; periodontal disease. Fire accidents was already among the top ten causes of burden in urban areas, in the estimate using expert rating of disability weights. Here with community rated disability weights, fire accidents show up among the ten leading causes of burden both in rural and urban areas. But self-inflicted injuries recede lower down, since most of the burden under this cause is due to suicides. The disease burden due to fire accidents and suicides are manifestations of social problems.</p>

        <br>
        <p class="ihs-para">Inputs from the Global Burden of Disease study (World Bank, 1993; Murray and Lopez, 1996) were used to generate the minimally anchored NBD estimates for Andhra Pradesh. The final results of the first global burden of disease study were published in 1996 - GBD96. By the time of this final revision, causes of death in urban areas of Maharashtra had been gathered by the Andhra Pradesh Burden of Disease Study, to approximate the mortality experience in urban areas of India. The urban cause of death data from Maharashtra was incorporated by the GBD96 study for the Indian estimates (Murray and Lopez, 1996 p139). In the present study, urban causes of death data remain the same while rural causes of death data have been a recent addition. The GBD96 study also had access to some preliminary insights from the pilot study on rural cause of death in Andhra Pradesh (Murray and Lopez, 1996 p140). Since the GBD96 study already incorporates a lot of local information on causes of death, it will be interesting to look at the first GBD estimates published in the World Development Report, 1993 (World Bank, 1993). Call this the WDR93. The WDR93 results used here for comparative purposes are the results taken for India directly from the World Development Report . The GBD96 based estimates have been computed for Andhra Pradesh using the cause-specific mortality proportions, incidence, and duration data for India as used by the GBD96 study. The GBD96 disability weights are also used as such. These general demographic estimates are common inputs to the GBD96 based estimate and the intermediately anchored estimates for Andhra Pradesh.</p>
